componentor
===========

this repos synchronizer can automatically synchronize repositories, transform/process each revision to fit component style and test the component before pushing it to destination repo.

thus you need to maintain only processor. 
I am planning to expand the support for more popular libs.

libs supported:
* underscore
* backbone

TODO: libs
* jquery
* knockout
* angular
* twitter-bootstrap
